    "body": "\\r\\nI have been an Enron stockholder for several years  and I am very disappointed with the events of the last two weeks.  I find  the allegations of accounting irregularities incredible.  I would like to  know how closely the board had been monitoring the activities of the CFO and  whether it approved the partnerships that have led to the SEC investigation and  the dramatic decline in the company\\'s stock price.  I would suggest that  the compensation of senior management may be too heavily weighted towards  bonuses (giving some the incentive to manipulate the numbers to increase their  bonuses) and not heavily weighted enough towards stock options.  I would  hope in the future the goals of the board and senior management will be aligned  with stockholders (increasing shareholder value).  While I know it is not  reason to have expected the stock price to stay in the high 80s, I consider the  drop in the last two weeks (apparently as the result of fraud) to be  inexcusable.  I believe the board owes all stockholders an explanation that  will finally clear the air about this mess (maybe the markets will trust Enron  again if it replaces evasion with candor).  Please help return credibility  and ethics to this company, which apparently are badly needed.\\r\\n \\r\\nWayne Heilman\\r\\nOwner of 1,800 Enron shares (in my children\\'s  college fund)\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n***********\\r\\nEDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

    "body": "Here is this months report. It is good to report solid momentum and good\\r\\nmorale in all regions and this report highlights a number of great\\r\\nsuccesses. Clearly we have had supply challenges so non-linear quarter\\r\\nagain, as you well know. We shall be working September hard!\\r\\n\\r\\nRegards\\r\\nPeter\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Compaq Confidential - Internal Use Only]\\r\\n\\r\\nWorldwide Sales & Services team:\\r\\n\\r\\nMy travel report this month spans the Americas - from our operations in\\r\\nLatin America to those in Canada. I had many opportunities to visit with\\r\\nour sales and services employees as well as customers, partners, press and\\r\\nanalysts. It\\'s really great to have a role that brings me into regular\\r\\ncontact with employees and our external audiences - it\\'s very exciting to\\r\\nsee how the momentum is building around the Corporation.\\r\\n\\r\\nLatin America has been very successful in its direct and partner\\r\\ninitiatives, particularly in Argentina, where we are now 55% direct, and\\r\\nBrazil which has 60% direct business. Our LA e-Business Development team is\\r\\nmaking tremendous strides to strategically position our business in the fast\\r\\ngrowing Internet space, while opening up new and exciting revenue streams.\\r\\nIn just four months of existence, the team has completed several new\\r\\nalliances with companies investing in the huge growth potential of the\\r\\nInternet in the region. Key alliances in this exciting new \"ecosystem\"\\r\\ninclude:\\r\\n\\r\\nDiveo, a provider of integrated hosting and security services, secures\\r\\nCompaq\\'s position as preferred vendor for this potentially huge customer.\\r\\nIt also allows us to offer critical enabling services that will accelerate\\r\\nthe adoption of the Internet and many valuable services in the region.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe entered a strategic alliance agreement with Artikos, a joint venture\\r\\nbetween Commerce One and Banamex, the largest bank in Mexico. The terms of\\r\\nthe alliance permit Compaq to sell the Commerce One solution to the many\\r\\noff-line and on-line companies investing in B2B marketplaces. It also\\r\\npositions us to participate as strategic partners in new marketplaces being\\r\\nformed by established brick-and-mortar players.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur strategic alliance with Terra, a leading regional portal, has begun to\\r\\ngenerate exciting new revenue streams stemming from a customer\\r\\nacquisition/traffic arrangement using our Presario keyboard buttons. In\\r\\njust four months of operation, we successfully sent 12 million visitors to\\r\\nthe Terra portal and gained from traffic and revenue sharing arrangements\\r\\nthat form part of the alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\nPatagon.com - Our first Internet alliance, at a time when few, if any,\\r\\ncompanies recognized the Internet\\'s potential in Latin America, continues to\\r\\npay important dividends. Patagon.com has grown to become the leading\\r\\nfinancial portal in LA with the help of Compaq technology. We also are\\r\\nhelping sustain Patagon\\'s growth in the market through a revenue generating\\r\\ntraffic alliance that links our customers to Patagon\\'s portal through our\\r\\neasy access keyboard buttons.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the coming months, you will surely be hearing more about these and other\\r\\nnew alliances that are transforming Compaq into a leading e-business in the\\r\\nregion.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanadian highlights\\r\\nMy trip north yielded not only relief from the Texas heat, but also many\\r\\nother great examples of progress that contributed to our Q2 results. As you\\r\\nprobably know, David Booth, a 13-year veteran with Compaq and Digital, was\\r\\nnamed President and Managing Director of our Canada operations in May. In\\r\\nQ2, the region increased their profits by 88% over Q299 and helped return\\r\\nCPCG to profitability. Earlier this year, Compaq Canada launched eStore\\r\\noperations, and with other direct enhancements, expects to be 85% direct by\\r\\nthe end of this year. Their Consumer Call Centre is racking up awards too -\\r\\nboth as Compaq Call Center of the Year, and from Call Center Magazine as the\\r\\nHigh Technology Call Center of the Year. Product awards in Canada include:\\r\\n - ProLiant server received Computer Dealer News\\' 2000 Reseller\\r\\nChoice Award\\r\\n - Deskpro PC received ChannelLine Magazine\\'s 2000 ChannelLine\\r\\nChamps Award\\r\\n - Aero/iPAQ Pocket PCs became the first monitoring devices for\\r\\ndiabetes in the world through Charles H. Best Diabetes Centre\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd last, but certainly not least, some great wins: Banque Nationale, $2.1M\\r\\nfor Himalaya systems and services; Province of New Brunswick, $2M for MS\\r\\nExchange; Capital Health Region, $2M Deskpro/Armada PCs; Lotto Quebec, $1.5M\\r\\nfor Himalaya systems; CanJet, $1.5M for ProLiant servers; SoftChoice, $800K\\r\\nfor SANs; Ontario Lottery Corporation, $800K ProLiant servers; University of\\r\\nToronto, $790K Alpha Cluster; SaskTel, $700K Deskpro PCs; and Atlantic\\r\\nHealth Science Centre, $500K AlphaServer systems\\r\\n.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorld\\'s fastest and most powerful supercomputer\\r\\nToday we are announcing that the U.S. Department of Energy\\'s National\\r\\nNuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has selected Compaq to build the\\r\\nworld\\'s fastest and most powerful supercomputer, a 30+ TeraOPS system\\r\\ncode-named \"Q.\" The contract is valued at more than $200M, and the\\r\\nsupercomputer will be housed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los\\r\\nAlamos, New Mexico. The supercomputer will support NNSA\\'s integrated\\r\\nprogram of surveillance, experiments, non-nuclear tests, archived data,\\r\\nmodeling and simulation to assess and certify the safety, security and\\r\\nreliability of nuclear weapons without underground nuclear testing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe supercomputer will consist initially of some 375 AlphaServer GS320\\r\\nsystems (approximately 12,000 Alpha processors) with EV68 CPUs running in\\r\\nexcess of 1,250 MHz on our Tru64UNIX operating system. Almost the size of\\r\\nfive basketball courts (more than 21,000 square feet), the system will have\\r\\nmore than 600 terabytes of Compaq StorageWorks storage, and receive onsite\\r\\n24x7 service and support. This major win, plus other recent wins (see\\r\\nNational Science Foundation below) are expected to establish Compaq as the\\r\\nNo. 1 provider in the high performance technical systems and servers\\r\\nmarketplace before the end of this year. A great recognition for Compaq,\\r\\nthe Business Critical Server Group, and the outstanding sales teams!\\r\\n\\r\\nOur other largest wins this month were:\\r\\nAlcatel Telecom (France) - $60M global upgrade for billing system based on\\r\\nAlphaServers running Tru64 UNIX-based NECTAR middleware. Alcatel builds\\r\\nnext-generation networks in more than 130 countries\\r\\nBMC Software (U.S.) - Beat Dell and HP for a $13 M desktop, portable and\\r\\nProfessional Workstation contract\\r\\nThe Cabinet Office (U.K.) - Beat Logica and Admiral for a five-year, $32M\\r\\ncontract in which we were named prime contractor to design, build and\\r\\noperate IT infrastructure.

It states simplification, a\\r\\ncustomer-centric approach, information access products and a clarified\\r\\nchannel strategy are keys to Compaq\\'s comeback. Preliminary 2Q market share\\r\\nfigures from IDC also confirm our progress in a number of other key areas.\\r\\nFor example:\\r\\n * Compaq led the WW PC server market with 30.2%, more than the\\r\\nNo. 2 (Dell) and No. 3 (IBM) vendors combined\\r\\n * We ranked second in WW portables, with 12.8%, up 2.2 points\\r\\nQ/Q\\r\\n * In Japan, we moved up to No. 7 position, past Apple, in\\r\\ntotal PCs, and regained our No. 2 server position from Fujitsu-Siemens, with\\r\\na 13.5% share\\r\\n * In Asia Pacific, we passed HP in desktops, moving up to No.\\r\\n4\\r\\n * And according to DataQuest, EMEA achieved the No. 1 Consumer\\r\\nranking in Western Europe with a 13.4% share, growing twice as fast as the\\r\\nmarket\\r\\nFor more information about the preliminary market share results of 2Q, or\\r\\nour final results in 1Q, check the links at\\r\\n<http://inline.compaq.com/wwss/facts.asp>\\r\\n\\r\\nWinning news from Global Accounts\\r\\nOur Global Accounts team not only wins new business, but also accolades for\\r\\nits videos and CDs that are used to help win business. Trophies include two\\r\\nat the AXIEM (Absolute Excellence in Electronic Media) Awards in the U.S.,\\r\\nand the Telly Awards for non-network broadcasts, comparable to a U.S. TV\\r\\nshow winning an Emmy.\\r\\n<http://newscpq1.inline.cpqcorp.net/article.cfm?storyid=968>\\r\\n\\r\\nService Provider/.com wins\\r\\nData Return, a leading global provider of advanced managed hosting services,\\r\\nwas recognized by Microsoft as \"Global Hosting Partner of the Year\" during\\r\\nthe Fusion 2000 Awards Banquet. The award noted Data Return\\'s ongoing work\\r\\nwith the Windows 2000 team in developing managed hosting solutions for\\r\\ncustomers whose applications are based on the Microsoft platform. This\\r\\nrepresents a tremendous win for Compaq as well, since Data Return is using\\r\\nCompaq hardware and services exclusively for its hosting services.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 31st, Compaq, Microsoft, Digex and IDC launched a series of Webcasts\\r\\nto help educate Compaq Field Sales and the Compaq/Microsoft Channel. The\\r\\nseries, presented by a top IDC analyst, emphasized the tremendous market\\r\\nopportunity within the ASP market. Based on the overwhelming participation\\r\\nand positive feedback, there is a strong interest in learning more about the\\r\\nASP market. The second in the series will be presented September 7. To\\r\\nregister, call 800-289-0579 (outside US 719-457-2550).\\r\\n\\r\\nCoconut.com, an ASP in the UK initially offering mail and messaging, has\\r\\nnamed Compaq its key partner. The solution, heavily leveraged around our\\r\\nProfessional Services capability, is Alpha and StorageWorks running\\r\\nSoftware.com\\'s suite of carrier-grade mail and messaging products. The\\r\\ninfrastructure will be managed by eBMS. HP had been working on this for 18\\r\\nmonths, and Compaq got engaged the day before they were about to sign the\\r\\ndeal. Seven weeks later HP was told they had lost the opportunity. The key\\r\\nto our success was a partnering approach to help them with their business,\\r\\nnot just to sell them tin. The near-term opportunity is $5M, with up to\\r\\n$25M over 5 years. Congratulations to the UK team!\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat Compaq Financial Services deals\\r\\nSupply Access - CFS is providing a $6.5M financing facility on Alpha and NT\\r\\nservers for this service provider, owned by En Point, one of Compaq\\'s\\r\\nlargest resellers in California. The deal, which displaced HP and HP\\r\\nFinance, includes a two-year exclusivity agreement.\\r\\n\\r\\nAvantel - CFS also completed a $3.5M deal to refresh the installed base of\\r\\nAvantel\\'s existing Compaq desktops and servers in Mexico. While Avantel is\\r\\na longtime Compaq customer, the inclusion of Compaq Financial Services\\r\\nenabled a complex sale and lease back arrangement for the acquisition of\\r\\nCompaq equipment, with opportunities for ongoing contact with the customer.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoundup of Storage news\\r\\nAs you may have noticed from the earnings news, the Storage Product Group\\r\\nhad a strong Q2, with profitability of $179M, up 45% from last year. SPG\\r\\ndelivered 11.8% of Compaq\\'s net sales, 17.8% of total gross margin, and a\\r\\nwhopping 31.6 % of Compaq\\'s operating income. Other news from the Storage\\r\\nfront includes:\\r\\n * A SANworks print ad campaign, directed at corporate CIOs,\\r\\nstarted on July 10th and will be running for several weeks. The ads direct\\r\\ncustomers to a Web companion page for more information, go to\\r\\n<http://www.compaq.com/sanworks>.\\r\\n * On August 22, Compaq will open a new Enterprise Storage\\r\\nCustomer Center (ESCC) in Colorado Springs, Colo., that will develop and\\r\\nqualify advanced network storage technologies for complex enterprise\\r\\nenvironments and offer training for IT professionals. The Center will\\r\\ncomplement the new Storage Networking Technology Center that was announced\\r\\nearlier this spring by the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA)\\r\\nand is currently being constructed by Compaq. Both centers will be housed\\r\\nunder one roof when the SNIA center opens later this year.\\r\\n * The Storage Networks Solutions Business Unit, focused on\\r\\nproviding leading-edge solutions to the industry, has created a Business\\r\\nDevelopment Team. For more information, contact Frank Orlando, who leads the\\r\\nteam.\\r\\n\\r\\nZero Latency and other BCSG attention-getters\\r\\nWhat debuted 10 months ago at Telecom99 as a riveting demonstration of\\r\\nCompaq\\'s first Zero Latency Enterprise (ZLE) technology has matured into a\\r\\nformal go-to-market program that will be launched and rolled out in October.\\r\\nIts goal? To help you identify ZLE opportunities and win deals. The\\r\\nBusiness Critical Server Group (BCSG) has established the ZLE Initiative to\\r\\nencompass all of our enterprise offerings - Himalaya; AlphaServer with Tru64\\r\\nUnix and OpenVMS; and ProLiant with Windows NT, as well as storage, clients\\r\\nand services. It will differentiate Compaq in the marketplace, generate\\r\\nmomentum for the company, and give us \"first-to-market\" status. No other\\r\\ncompetitor can come close to what we offer. The typical ZLE deal profile is\\r\\nhigh-revenue - $15M per deal - and high-margin, so the payoff is great.\\r\\nStay tuned for announcements in October, including info on ZLE customers;\\r\\ncool new offerings incorporating platforms, partners and services; new\\r\\ndemos; go-to-market tools to help you tell the ZLE story; ZLE expertise to\\r\\nassist with your accounts; and press and analyst proof points to help you\\r\\nsell. I encourage you to learn more about ZLE so you can leverage its\\r\\nrevenue potential. For more information, contact your BCSG region drivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther highlights from BCSG:\\r\\n * Congratulations to the Tandem BU for its Q2 performance, the\\r\\nsecond highest in revenue for the BU in Compaq history. In addition, the\\r\\nS74 series had the fastest ramp in the history of the Himalaya platform,\\r\\nwith $69M in S74000 processors shipped since its May launch.\\r\\n * MUZO, a Czech payment authorization agency and long-time\\r\\ncustomer, will migrate to the most powerful of the Himalaya servers, the\\r\\nS74000, for its new authorization center opening in 1Q01. MUZO provides\\r\\nATM/POS authorization and back-office services using Base24 from partner\\r\\nACI. The order is important for Compaq in the Czech Republic because it\\r\\npositions the platform firmly in the country and demonstrates the success of\\r\\nthe ongoing efforts of the Czech subsidiary to build local Himalaya\\r\\nresources and skills.\\r\\n * The \"Dream Machine\" roadshow, which showcases the\\r\\nAlphaServer GS160 server running OpenVMS Galaxy, is starting its North\\r\\nAmerican tour. One of its first stops was in Boston in late July, where it\\r\\nreceived an enthusiastic response from the Compaq Board of Directors.\\r\\n * Recently named a partner for Oracle\\'s iHost applications\\r\\nhosting initiative, Nupremis is the first service provider to announce that\\r\\nit will host Oracle iHost applications on AlphaServers running Tru64 UNIX in\\r\\nits data centers to provide the most scalable and highly available platform\\r\\nfor e-business.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat things happening in the Consumer world\\r\\n* In 1Q, Compaq surpassed Packard Bell as the US installed base market\\r\\nshare leader for the first time, according to Media Metrix. The number of\\r\\nCompaq PCs in US homes has increased 260% to 5.4 million from 1997 through\\r\\n1Q.\\r\\n* Presario portable PCs maintained their No. 1 U.S. retail sales share\\r\\nin June for the 22nd consecutive month, according to NPD Intelect\\r\\n* The Presario 1200XL-110 was rated a Best Buy and No. 1 Budget\\r\\nnotebook by PC World magazine\\r\\n* The Presario 1800T was rated the No. 5 Power notebook by PC World\\r\\nmagazine\\r\\n* Compaq\\'s 2Q consumer PC sales in Malaysia were up over 1,200%, due\\r\\nlargely to Compaq\\'s kiosk strategy there. The kiosks have been successful\\r\\nenough to be featured in the Far East Economic Review\\r\\n* Compaq beat out four other PC manufacturers to partner with\\r\\nspecialty retailer Eddie Bauer on special edition Presario 1400 series\\r\\nportable PCs\\r\\n\\r\\nJoint news from Consumer and CPCG\\r\\nBy now I\\'m sure you\\'ve read about the exciting new additions to the iPAQ\\r\\nfamily of products and services, announced jointly by Mike Larson and Mike\\r\\nWinkler in New York on August 15. The announcement symbolizes the growing\\r\\nconvergence of the commercial and consumer markets, and the mutual desire\\r\\nfor information and Internet access by our customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, CPCG deserves special congratulations on their outstanding 2Q\\r\\nresults - returning to profitability one quarter ahead of what was expected!\\r\\nAll regions were profitable, contributing to the total $63M in operating\\r\\nprofit. The group achieved the best portable shipment quarter on record,\\r\\nshipped the 100,000th iPAQ desktop, and the iPAQ Pocket PC demand is 10\\r\\ntimes the initial forecast! And by the looks of all the commercial products\\r\\nwins listed in this report, the momentum is continuing. For an interesting\\r\\nQ&A by CNET News.com with Mike Winkler on the group\\'s achievement, see:\\r\\n<http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-201-2375731-0.html>\\r\\n\\r\\nNew ISSG product announcements and recognition\\r\\nISSG has been busy with a lot of new product announcements, including the\\r\\nindustry\\'s first high-performance network attached server appliance, the\\r\\nTaskSmart N-Series, new clustering solutions for SCO, Oracle and Microsoft.\\r\\nMore news includes:\\r\\n * The ProLiant 8500 is now Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 Best Performance\\r\\non the TPC-C top 10 list. The Compaq Benchmarks result in a Price/tpmC that\\r\\nis approximately $10 lower than the top marking IBM number and is using SQL\\r\\nServer 2000 instead of DB2. We even pushed the Sun 10000 off the top 10\\r\\nlist.\\r\\nCheck out the great review and double awards for the ProLiant DL360 by\\r\\nInternetWeek Magazine, titled, \"Rack \\'Em Up.\"\\r\\n<http://www.internetwk.com/reviews00/rev071700.htm>\\r\\n\\r\\nCompaq dominates Commerce One\\'s Global Trading Web portals\\r\\nNot only do we power C1\\'s own MarketSite.net U.S. portal and all its hosted\\r\\ninstallations, but we also power an overwhelming number of its major portal\\r\\npartners.

Greed whispers to all of us, and I am thankful for being able to see and experience its devastating effects on individuals, families and organizations.

Building on the \\r\\nsuccess of that event, I would like to invite you to make the  keynote \\r\\naddress at Energy & Power Risk Management  Conferences\\x01, third annual \\r\\ninformation technology event as  outlined above. This year\\'s keynote session \\r\\nis entitled \"The E-Commerce Revolution: Innovations and  opportunity in the \\r\\nelectronic energy marketplace\". This session has no  bullet points as I would \\r\\nlike the speaker to address only the latest issues as  they see fit. My \\r\\nresearch has showed that the industry is very interested in  your opinions on \\r\\nthis subject and I hope you can fit this hour-long session into  you busy \\r\\nschedule.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x01+Information Technology\\x01, will take a focused look  at the latest advances \\r\\nbeing made in the energy market\\x01,s systems and  technologies. The conference \\r\\nwill be structured in two streams, offering  delegates and speakers the \\r\\nchance to tailor the event to their own areas of  interest. The streams will \\r\\nbe partitioned into five areas: \\r\\n\\r\\n1) Information technology for risk management\\r\\n\\r\\n2) Information technology for pricing and trading\\r\\n\\r\\n3) Data techniques and strategies\\r\\n\\r\\n4) Advanced technologies for trading and risk management\\r\\n\\r\\n5) Challenges of the evolving energy marketplace\\r\\n\\r\\nEach of these categories will investigate the kind of problems  being faced \\r\\nby energy IT/IS managers, traders and risk managers alike. I have  attached a \\r\\ncopy of the program for your information. There will also be a  software \\r\\nexhibition at the conference at which vendors will be demonstrating  their \\r\\nproducts, as well as a post-conference seminar on data management.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis conference will be of the highly technical level that  people have come \\r\\nto expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage  participation \\r\\nfrom speakers in modifying the program to suit the audience and  issues at \\r\\nhand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please  let \\r\\nme know; any help would be gratefully received.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy  & Power Risk \\r\\nManagement Magazine and our extensive database.

    "keyword": "buy sell",
    "body": "Ken,  I thought it would be better if I typed my thoughts for you since my \\r\\nhand writing can be somewhat difficult to read. \\r\\n\\r\\nBefore you decide the methodology for moving our project beyond the D. Ambani \\r\\nphone call, I would like to share a few thoughts that I believe reduces the \\r\\nrisk of Enron being an E&P buyer.  I know the implications of making a large \\r\\nE&P purchase are far greater than just the cash requirement, but I believe \\r\\nwith the following changes to the plan presented yesterday and a little 3rd \\r\\nparty information, you may feel more comfortable making this decision.  Under \\r\\nthe buy/sell arrangement a small risk of buying will always be present, but I \\r\\nbelieve the risk reward ratio in this case has very strong merit.  My goals \\r\\nfor Enron are three fold; a) sale the assets, b) get cash in the door before \\r\\nyear-end, and c) get fair value for the assets given the current situation.  \\r\\nMy comments touch upon five topics:\\r\\n\\r\\n1)  Reverse the buy/sell process giving Enron the control vote\\r\\n2)  Pay the Penalty\\r\\n3) Contact someone at the Janus Fund to talk about Reliance\\'s Financial \\r\\ncondition\\r\\n4) Thoughts on non-Reliance bidder\\'s\\r\\n5) Information and the future process\\r\\n\\r\\nReverse the Buy/Sell Process:   The plan outlined yesterday using the \\r\\nbuy/sell scenario is the best scenario for achieving all of our goals.  The \\r\\nrisk for Enron which is most troubling is the possibility of being a buyer \\r\\nversus a desire to be a seller.  I firmly believe if we make one change to \\r\\nthe plan as described below, we can increase our probability of a successful \\r\\nsale to near 100%.  If we don\\'t use a but/sell arrangement I am concerned \\r\\nthat we will not get fair value or cash in the door this year.   In fact, I \\r\\nsuspect we will elect not to sell because of contract or valuation problems, \\r\\nwhich in effect leave us with a stranded asset and a lot of employee \\r\\nproblems.   \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you talk with Dhirubhai we can propose the buy/sell concept  with RIL \\r\\nmaking the first bid to purchase.  Enron then has the right to sell at that \\r\\nprice or increase the bid by 5% and RiL must sell.  Since we are now in the \\r\\ncontrol position the 10% tax logic we talked about yesterday no longer is \\r\\nvalid, so I would describe the 5% as a control premium.  The only reason we \\r\\nwant the buy option is in the event they offer a very low number.  I would \\r\\nsuspect them to bid in the $550 to $650 million range.  They just turned down \\r\\nmy offer to purchase their assets at $450mm and indicated we were \\r\\nsubstantially below their value when I tried to engage them in a dialogue.  \\r\\nThey know Enron paid $620 million just 12 months ago for the same position.  \\r\\nWe know they internally have reserves booked higher than ours and have a \\r\\nstrong desire to have a substantial upstream position that they can control.  \\r\\nIt is possible that RIL would bid less than $500 million but I put that \\r\\nprobability at less than one percent.  This reduces Enron\\'s risk dramatically \\r\\nand increases our probability of getting all of our objectives met. We also \\r\\nget an added benefit, from pitching the deal with RIL as the first bidder,  \\r\\nbecause this will  strengthen the perception that we (Enron) want to be the \\r\\nbuyer, which is a key perception to have a fair auction with only one \\r\\nlegitimate buyer, Reliance.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf we  pitch the deal as suggested above,  we need to recognise going in that \\r\\nthey probably want the control position as well.  I believe they would pay a \\r\\nvery large value for these assets due to their tax position and by bidding \\r\\nfirst they take great risk of leaving a lot of money on the table or not \\r\\ngetting the deal at all.   I would suspect that they will at a minimum \\r\\nsuggest we flip a coin to see who bids first.  Initially I would just say no, \\r\\nbut we may need to deal with this issue and probably should decide early on \\r\\nif it is a deal killer.  If we did flip a coin, we would wait until the \\r\\ndocuments were final and the escrow agreement was signed so there would be no \\r\\nbacking out without a penalty.  In this scenario it would actually help get a \\r\\nmore impartial document done quicker if neither party knew the bidding \\r\\nsequence until after the drafting was finalized.\\r\\n\\r\\nPay the Penalty: While it is not the way we want to do business, the worst \\r\\ncase scenario under the proposed escrow agreement is to forfeit  $25 million \\r\\nif we elected not to follow through in an Enron  buy scenario.   Considering \\r\\nthe upside to the buy/sell under either sequence (Enron first or RIL first) \\r\\nit may be worth the risk of losing the escrow under a black Friday scenario.  \\r\\nI want to think about this over the weekend, but while I was thinking this \\r\\nafternoon the risk reward seems to be very favorable.  \\r\\n\\r\\nContact someone at Janus Fund:  This was suggested yesterday and I would \\r\\nstrongly urge you to do this if you feel comfortable making the inquiry.  \\r\\nJanus bought approximately a  5% position in RIL about 1-2 months ago.  I \\r\\nthink you will get a very positive report on both the cash front and their \\r\\ndesire to make the upstream a key part of the company.\\r\\n\\r\\nThoughts on Non- Reliance Bidders:  I have spent a lot more time thinking \\r\\nabout this issue.   I can talk you through the reasons, but as long as \\r\\nReliance is involved and a western company can only purchase a 30% \\r\\nnon-operated working interest, we will have to take a huge discount to fair \\r\\nvalue.  I will be very surprised if we could get $450 million.  Again, going \\r\\nto the Shell\\'s, BG\\'s,,,etc  early on in the process,  I believe, is a huge \\r\\nmistake, both internally and externally.\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation Flow and Process:  Ken this is a very sensitive area but I feel \\r\\ncompelled to mention this to you.  I am concerned about too many people \\r\\nknowing our plan and strategy and possibly others wanting to branch out with \\r\\nthe intentions of helping, but actually causing problems.  This needs to be \\r\\nmanaged by one person, not three or four.  To meet all of our objectives this \\r\\nhas to be an orchestrated deal from a to z.  I think you know more about my \\r\\nbackground then most others in Enron.  I worked the E&P M&A business for 10 \\r\\nyears and did pretty well at it.  I know the oil business and I believe that \\r\\nis a key to getting a good deal done.  I know these assets and all of the \\r\\ncomplex issues surrounding the assets, our subsidiaries, tax issues and the \\r\\nbook considerations.  I\\'m the best person to get this deal done once you \\r\\ndecide the risk the company is willing to take.  I know the limits of my \\r\\nauthority and I will work within those bounds and keep the OOC completely and \\r\\ntotally informed so proper decisions can be made when necessary. \\r\\n\\r\\nKen, I promise you I will use others in the company where and when \\r\\nappropriate.  If I need help in India, I would not hesitate to ask Sanjay for \\r\\nsuch.  However, the last thing we can afford is excess discussion in India on \\r\\nthis deal.  If Dhirubhai agrees to the deal, we need to get a meeting set in \\r\\nEurope at a neutral site to start the process.  My main objective is to  have \\r\\na successful deal.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI have decided not to go to India so we can concentrate on moving this \\r\\nforward.  Also, I will need your guidance on the future of the E&P plans for \\r\\nEnron when we decide the direction we plan to take on Panna, Mukta and \\r\\nTapti.  I have looked at the key people necessary to make this happen and can \\r\\ntalk to you about that as well if you so desire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks\\r\\njeff\\r\\n\\r\\n***********\\r\\nEDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

Both agencies have been briefed on the contents of next week\\'s earnings release as well as the pending equity adjustment associated with the Raptor transactions. On Monday, our analysts at both agencies will be briefing their rating committees on the Enron announcement. They will then contact us with their official rating decision. Andy, Ben and I feel that a proactive call from you today will positively impact the message our analysts deliver to their committees.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased upon the discussions with the analysts held over the last two days it is apparent that several key assurances from Enron senior management are sought. They are as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nEnron is Committed to Maintaining its Credit Ratings - emphasize that the ratings are critical to the fundamental businesses which drive our success, gas and power marketing. Note that both our counterparties and creditors place great weight on our consistent rating profile. Due to this, the agencies should be confident that we will aggressively defend the ratings.\\r\\nOur Core Businesses are Strong - We are the leading franchise in energy marketing. We anticipate continued strength in the financial performance from the commodity groups. No charges to be taken are associated with our ongoing businesses.\\r\\nPortland General and Other Asset Sales will Occur - Proceeds from these divestitures are material and will be applied first to allow us to get our leverage statistics back in line quickly. \\r\\nReemphasize Your Commitment To Simplifying Financial Reporting - The analysts have given considerable consideration to you public statements associated with providing more detailed information to the financial community regarding our performance. \\r\\nAcknowledge Remaining Issues Facing the Company - The agencies are following the developments on Dhabol, the valuation of the EBS fiber optic network, and the ongoing Azurix/Wessex performance. Provide comfort that we believe the ultimate resolution of these items will not have a material adverse impact on our credit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have any questions or comments, Ben will join you 15 minutes prior to the first call. \\r\\n\\r\\nRegards,\\r\\nTim DeSpain\\r\\nx31770\\r\\n\\r\\nMoody\\'s Call:\\r\\nJohn Diaz\\r\\n11:45AM\\r\\n\\r\\nStandard & Poor\\'s Call:\\r\\nRon Barone\\r\\n2:30PM\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n***********\\r\\nEDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.
